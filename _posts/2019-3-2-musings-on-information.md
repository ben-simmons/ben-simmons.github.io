title: Musings on Information
---

Information is the measure of certainty. It is the most primitive unit of description. It is a fundamental property of the universe. It tethers the abstract plane to the physical.

Truth is information about reality. Information that does not correspond to reality is false. Information can be fractionally true and false, as with probabilities.

A statement is a mapping of information to information. When the information is the same on both sides of the mapping, the statement is a tautology. Statements can be true, false, or both via superimposition.

A fact is a statement where information on both sides of the mapping is true.

Causation is a mapping of facts via logical implication.

Knowledge is a set of facts and causations.

Context is a collection of knowledge sets.

Intelligence is the ability to synthesize information maps. It is the ability to transform information. It often involves inference of facts and causations that are not part of a knowledge set.

Wisdom is the ability to accurately infer facts and causations using heuristical reasoning on a large set of context.
